        "1.  **Set up a Figure:** Create a Matplotlib figure and an axis, just like for a static plot. This will be the \"canvas\" for our animation.\n",
        "2.  **Initial Plot Element:** Plot the first frame (e.g., our initial temperature profile) on this figure. We get a \"line object\" (or other plot artists) that we can then update.\n",
        "3.  **Update Function:** Define a Python function that tells Matplotlib how to change the plot for each subsequent frame. This function will typically:\n",
        "    *   Take a `frame_index` as input.\n",
        "    *   Use this index to get the data for the current frame (e.g., `T_results[frame_index]`).\n",
        "    *   Update the properties of our line object (e.g., its y-data) with this new data.\n",
        "4.  **Animation Object:** Use `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation` to orchestrate the process. This function repeatedly calls our update function to generate all the frames.\n",

        "    *   It must return a tuple of the artists that were modified.\n",
        "*   **`frames`**: The total number of frames to generate. For us, this will be the number of temperature profiles we stored in `T_results`.\n",
        "*   **`init_func` (optional but good practice, especially with `blit=True`):**\n",
        "    *   A function *you define* that is called once at the beginning to set up the plot before the first frame is drawn. It's used to draw a \"clean slate\" or initial background.\n",
        "    *   It must also return a tuple of the artists.\n",
        "*   **`interval`**: The delay between frames in milliseconds (e.g., `100` ms for 10 frames per second).\n",
        "*   **`blit` (optional, `True` or `False`):**\n",
        "    *   If `True`, `FuncAnimation` tries to optimize drawing by only redrawing plot elements that have changed. This can make animations smoother but can sometimes be tricky to set up correctly or cause issues with certain Matplotlib backends.\n",
