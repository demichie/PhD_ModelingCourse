        "### Exercises: Exploring the Upwind Scheme with Animation\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you have the code to animate the Upwind scheme, try experimenting with it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Vary the CFL Number:**\n",
        "    *   In the animation code cell, change `CFL_anim` to values like `0.2`, `0.5`, `0.99`, and `1.0`. How does the numerical diffusion (smearing of the pulse) change with CFL?\n",
        "    *   What happens if you set `CFL_anim` to a value slightly greater than 1 (e.g., `1.05` or `1.1`)? Observe the animation carefully. Does the scheme remain stable? (The Upwind scheme should become unstable for CFL > 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Impact of Spatial Resolution ($\\Delta x$):**\n",
        "    *   Keep `CFL_anim` fixed (e.g., at `0.8`).\n",
        "    *   Change `nx_anim` to a smaller value (e.g., `51`, coarser grid) and then to a larger value (e.g., `201`, finer grid). Remember that `dt_anim` will change if CFL is fixed.\n",
        "    *   How does the numerical diffusion change with grid resolution for a fixed CFL? Does a finer grid always produce a \"sharper\" (less diffused) result at the same *physical time*?\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Long-Term Advection (Multiple Periods):**\n",
        "    *   Set `t_final_anim` such that the pulse should theoretically pass through the periodic domain multiple times (e.g., if $L=1, u=1$, set $t_{final}=2.0$ or $3.0$).\n",
        "    *   Observe how the numerical diffusion accumulates over time. Does the pulse degrade significantly after several traversals?\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Different Initial Conditions:**\n",
        "    *   Modify `phi_initial_anim` to be a **square wave** (top-hat function) instead of a Gaussian.\n",
        "        ```python\n",
        "        # Example for square wave:\n",
        "        # phi_initial_anim = np.zeros(nx_anim)\n",
        "        # start_index = int(0.15 / dx_anim)\n",
        "        # end_index = int(0.35 / dx_anim)\n",
        "        # phi_initial_anim[start_index:end_index+1] = 1.0\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "    *   How does the Upwind scheme handle the sharp discontinuities of the square wave? Observe the smearing of the edges.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **(Challenge) Mass Conservation Check with Animation:**\n",
        "    *   Modify the animation loop to calculate the total \"mass\" (integral of $\\phi$) at each animation frame: `total_phi = np.sum(phi_anim) * dx_anim`.\n",
        "    *   Plot this `total_phi` as a function of time (either in a separate plot or by adding text to the animation).\n",
        "    *   Does the Upwind scheme with periodic BCs conserve mass well? (It should, to a good approximation).\n",
        "\n",
        "These exercises will help you build a stronger intuition for the behavior of the Upwind scheme and the impact of numerical parameters."
